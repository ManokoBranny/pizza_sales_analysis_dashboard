# Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction

Hello, pizza enthusiasts! Welcome to the Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard, where we explore the sizzling world of pizza sales data. üçï My name is Manoko Langa, and I've embarked on a data-driven journey to uncover the secrets behind successful pizza sales and customer preferences.

## Project Overview

Have you ever wondered what makes pizza restaurants thrive? I've used the power of data analysis to reveal the hidden patterns and trends in pizza sales. In this project, we delve into a dataset comprising 48,620 rows and 19 columns, meticulously cleaned and processed to create a dynamic dashboard. This dashboard offers insights into the performance of a pizza restaurant, showcasing different slicers for an interactive exploration of pizza sales data.

## Key Questions Explored

To better understand the pizza business, I sought answers to crucial questions:

1. How many pizza orders were generated?
2. What's the total number of pizza units sold?
3. Which pizza category reigns supreme in sales?
4. During which quarter of the year are pizzas most in demand?
5. At what time of day do pizzas experience peak popularity?

## Findings

Here are some fascinating discoveries:

- Fridays are the reigning champions for pizza sales, followed closely by Saturdays and Thursdays. Sundays, on the other hand, see the lowest pizza sales, maintaining this pattern throughout the year.
- The most popular hours for pizza consumption are around 12 PM to 1 PM, tapering off until a resurgence at 4 PM to 5 PM. This likely relates to lunchtime and dinner preferences.
- The total revenue generated from pizza sales reached an impressive R799K.
- On average, customers tend to order just one pizza.
- The 'Classic' pizza category tops the charts as the customer favorite.

## How to Use This Dashboard

The interactive dashboard allows you to explore various dimensions of pizza sales data, including quarterly and monthly trends, daily variations, and more. Use the slicers to customize your view and uncover additional insights about pizza sales performance.
